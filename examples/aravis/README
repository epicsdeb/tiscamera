Aravis Examples
===============

These examples show how to address Gige cameras via the aravis
gstreamer plugin.

Getting started
---------------

To obtain aravis, visit to following link:

https://git.gnome.org/browse/aravis/

and download the latest archive.
Just follow the included instructions, but assure that you run
configure with
  --enable-gst-plugin
to enable the needed gstreamer plugin.

If you plan to use python or another non c compatible language,
you will have to set the additional flag
  --enable-introspection=yes
to enable gobject introspection to allow a seamless interaction with aravis.

The examples are all independent programs that show how to interact
with the aravis gstreamer plugin and how to embed such a gstreamer stream into
an application.

Dependencies
------------

Currently gstreamer-0.10 as well as gstreamer-0.10-plugins-bad are required.
