Dxx x2UC02 Firmware Update Utility
Copyright 2012 The Imaging Source Europe GmbH

v1.0 16.03.2012

### This is BETA software ! Use with caution ! ###

This firmware update utility writes an UVC compliant firmware into a
Dxx 72UC02 or Dxx 22UC03 CMOS camera. Please contact
support@theimagingsouce.com for questions regarding this utility.


1. Compilation
==============

To build the utility, extract all files to some directory and type
"make" in the archives root directory to build the necessary files.

2. Usage
========

IMPORTANT NOTE:

You may need to have ROOT privileges to run this tool!


2.1 Switch interface mode
=========================

There are two supported software interface modes for these cameras: 

 - UVC  ( USB Video Class interface )
 and
 - Proprietary

Use the command 

 ./euvccam-fw -m uvc

or

 ./euvccam-fw -m proprietary

to switch between the modes. 


2.2 Change color format
=======================

The color camera uses a color format that indicates a RGB bayer
pattern. This color format is currently not known to the driver and/or
to most software. To use the camera with existing software, replace
the camera firmware with the monochrome version for your camera.

A different firmware can be uploaded the following command: 

./euvccam-fw -u files/<firmware-file>

The first three characters of the firmware file specify whether the
firmware is a color or monochrome version. Firmware files starting
with "dfk" are color versions while files starting with "dmk" are
monochrome versions.

Example to change a DFK 72UC02 to monochrome format: 

./euvccam-fw -u files/dmk72uc02_*



After the firmware upload is complete, disconnect and reconnect the
camera to use the new firmware.


IMPORTANT: The utility creates a backup of the current firmware. To
return to the original firmware, you will need this backup file. It is
strongly recommended to save the firmware update utility and the
backup file for future use.


3. Notes on UVC compatibility
=============================

With the new firmware, the camera will be UVC compliant regarding to
the specifications but it will not output a color ( YUV ) image
itself. The image data will still be in RAW format for either the
monochrome or the color camera. It remains to the software to further
process the image data to get RGB or YUV color data.
